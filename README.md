# Notice! Read all comments on macros.

These are my macros my players use in game, a large majority of them written for Midi-qol or DAE usage. I am sure there are better ways to write some of them. I am totally open if you got any suggestions how to make these better. if you need to contact me, hit me up on `Crymic#9452` or @ me on `Foundry Discord`. Special thanks to @Tposney, @Kekilla0, @Kandashi, @VanceCole for helping me along the way.

If you wish to support what I am doing, head over to my **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/crymic)**.

I am now uploading all new macros for my Foundry 8.x to Patreon. Older 7.x macros are listed on my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/crymic/foundry-vtt-macros) account.
